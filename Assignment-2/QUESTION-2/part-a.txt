1. Call by Value
In call by value method of parameter passing, the values of actual parameters are copied to the
function’s formal parameters.
● There are two copies of parameters stored in different memory locations.
● One is the original copy and the other is the function copy.
● Any changes made inside functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the
caller.

2.Call by Reference
In call by reference method of parameter passing, the address of the actual parameters is
passed to the function as the formal parameters. In C, we use pointers to achieve
call-by-reference.
● Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations.
● Any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in the actual
parameters of the caller.
