q]Explain the need of function prototype with example

Function prototypes are essential for compile-time checking, allowing functions to be used before their
definitions, which supports modular programming. This simple declaration avoids errors and improves code
readability and organization, especially in large programs or complex systems.

Syntax of Functions in C
The syntax of function can be divided into 3 aspects:
1. Function Declaration
In a function declaration, one must provide the function name, its return type, and the
number and type of its parameters. A function declaration tells the compiler that there is a
function with the given name defined somewhere in the program.

2. Function Definition
The function definition consists of actual statements which are executed when the function is called

3. Function Calls
A function call is a statement that instructs the compiler to execute the function. We use the function name
and parameters in the function call.
