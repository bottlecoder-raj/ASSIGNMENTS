 Q]Explain recursion and write a recursive program for calculating factorial of a given number N. 

 ANSWER:
In C, it is possible for the functions to call themselves.
A function is called ‘recursive’ if a statement within the body of a function calls the same function. 
Sometimes called ‘circular definition’, recursion is thus the process of defining something in terms of itself.
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. 
programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
